# ModernTunes Ext JS Community application

* Follow this [tutorial](http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/6.6.0-CE/guides/quick_start/What_You_Will_Be_Coding.html) to create this application. 

The app is a custom **music video preview player** that will draw data from a public data feed from the 
**<a style="text-decoration:none" href="https://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes**</a>
website, specifically the top videos of latest period rating. 

The landing page (we are using a **TabPanel** component* in Ext JS) has two options to choose from: 

- The first is a collection of custom styled thumbnails (called a **Dataview** component in Ext JS) of the title of the song, along with the name and image of the artist.

- The second is a custom table of records of similar data (called a **Grid** component in Ext JS), while adding the release date of the song as well.

Each tab  allow for the rendering of a 30-second preview of a particular video in a hovering model window  (called a **Dialog** component in Ext JS), whether clicking on a thumbnail from the Dataview or a record from the Grid.

This app uses Ext JS Community Edition
